This task was a lot of fun and gave me the chance to try out a few new libraries that I haven't got
around to before such as view binding and fragment navigation.

I wasn't able to spend as much time as I'd have liked to as I'm on holiday so there are a few things
I wanted to implement but didn't have the time. These include:

- More instrumented tests for SearchFragment and navigation
- Error handling
- Loading states
- Caching and persistence
- Empty states for no search results/albums
- General UI improvements
- Experimenting with auto-search on text change, with throttling to ensure rate limit not exceeded
